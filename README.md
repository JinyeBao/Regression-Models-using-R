# Regression-Models-using-R
Hi, there are 3 projects using R here, including linear regression model and logistic regression model. 
In this analysis, we examined two datasets: EOTST2112023_GROW.csv and 
EOTST2112023_PUSA.csv. We found that the best model could be created using 
EOTST2112023_GROW.csv, thus our analysis focuses on a model created using this dataset. 
Our datasets were taken from the Next Steps Study (NS), A study tracking young individuals 
in England from age 14 until age 25. The individuals in the study were surveyed periodically 
to collect a wide variety of data on them as they progressed through life. 
The first data in the dataset were collected in 2004 when individuals in the survey were aged 
14, the survey then surveyed individuals periodically, until the latest sweep, which was done 
when participants were aged 25.
Our research question for this report is to determine the variables which have significant 
predictive power for an individual’s earnings at age 25. We view this question as important 
because if we know the factors which contribute towards an individual’s earnings at 25, we 
can then make policy recommendations that would influence these factors, with the hope 
that changing these factors could lead to more people earning a good income and raising 
living standards.
